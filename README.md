# search_engine
A search engine developed on programming lessons.

The interface is realized on a server which should be started on localhost (server_with_buttons function). 
A database should be pre-made using the indexer module (create_db_index function).

The project includes a number of sub-tasks: 
1) texts tokenizer
2) texts indexer
3) the module for searching
4) server and interface
5) morphological analyzer

Further details are available in the modules' descriptions and comments.
